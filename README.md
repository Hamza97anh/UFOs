# UFOs
## Overview of the analysis
Dana requested a website which allows end users to view a data array of UFO siting in the US. Using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, we created a website which allows for five different types of filters. A text section by a Ufologists, and a banner with an image pulled from NASA. 

## Results
Here is a quick demonstration of how the site works. At the top is the title with a banner like back drop. Below that a small text with expert opinion on UFOs and a description of what's in the data. At the bottom is the data and to the right of it is where you'll find the filters.

To you use the filters. First try entering a date as highlighted below.

There are lots of events on 1/1/2010, but say you're only interested in what happend in your own state. You can try entering "ca" for California to narrow down the search.

To take it a step further. You can filter by city. Say Fresno for example. You should see one event that happend on the first of Jan 2010.

## Summary

  The website serves as a good tool to view the data provided. However, there are some drawbacks. The main one being is that because of Java, filters are case sensative. All the data is in lowercase so it shouldn't affect the search results, but it's certinly a draw back, and would likely require more coding to accomdiate future data merges. This would likely be the first step for future improvments. The second and I believe the best step to take would be to add a interactive map which shows where all the events occured and making some type of indicator on the durations of the event for a better visual experiance, and ease of use.
